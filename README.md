A simple modern photo editor built in Java. with features like altering brightness, sharpness, contrast, B&W filter, and much more. The project is not a full fledged application but rather an experimental project I created just for learning purposes.

# About this project

This project was built using the default Java libraries (Swing and graphics). No additional 3rd party libraries were used for any image processing features.
The lookandFeel (Dark mac lookandFeel) is created by FlatLaf [https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/] A third party open source library for customising lookAndFeel of your swing application
I used the IntelliJ GUI designer for the frontend of this project, meaning part of the code is in XML (.form files) 
Created with java 21
